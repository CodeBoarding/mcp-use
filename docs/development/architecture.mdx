### Details

The `mcp-use` agent subsystem is designed around a central `Agent Core` that orchestrates interactions with various components to achieve its goals. It leverages a `Prompt Construction` module to dynamically generate context-rich prompts for the `LLM Interface`, which abstracts communication with large language models. For executing specific tasks, the `Agent Core` delegates to a `Tool Executor`, which manages the invocation of external capabilities. The `Conversational State Manager`, an intrinsic part of the `Agent Core`, maintains the dialogue history and context, ensuring coherent interactions. Additionally, a `Remote Execution Handler` allows the agent to offload tasks to remote MCP servers, extending its operational reach. This architecture emphasizes modularity, allowing for flexible integration of different LLMs and tools while maintaining a clear separation of concerns.

### Agent Core
The primary orchestrator and decision-making unit of the agent. It manages the overall flow, interprets LLM outputs, and decides on subsequent actions, including tool usage or further LLM interactions. It also encapsulates the conversational state management.

```

### Details

The authentication subsystem in `mcp_use.auth` is designed to handle OAuth 2.0 authentication flows and apply bearer tokens to outgoing HTTP requests. The `OAuth Handler` component, implemented by the `mcp_use.auth.oauth.OAuth` class, is responsible for orchestrating the OAuth process, including discovering server capabilities, dynamic client registration, and managing token storage. Once access tokens are acquired, the `Bearer Token Manager` component, implemented by `mcp_use.auth.bearer.BearerAuth`, takes these tokens and applies them as `Authorization: Bearer` headers to `External HTTP Requests`. This ensures secure communication with external services, such as MCP servers. The `OAuth Handler` provides the necessary access tokens to the `Bearer Token Manager`, which then uses them to authenticate `External HTTP Requests`.

### OAuth Handler
Manages the entire OAuth 2.0 protocol flow. This includes initiating authentication requests with external OAuth providers, handling redirects, and securely obtaining and storing access tokens. It acts as the primary interface for acquiring the necessary authentication credentials.

### Details

The `mcp-use` subsystem is orchestrated by the Command Line Interface (CLI), which serves as the primary user interaction point. The CLI is responsible for initiating various operations, including project setup and managing agent workflows. It interacts with the Configuration Manager to load and persist application and project-specific settings, ensuring consistent behavior across sessions. For interacting with external MCP servers, the CLI leverages the MCP Client, which handles communication, server command execution, and status reporting. The core intelligence of the system resides within the MCP Agent, which executes agentic workflows and integrates LLMs and tools. The CLI manages the execution of the MCP Agent and receives feedback on its operations. This architecture ensures a clear separation of concerns, with the CLI handling user input and orchestration, the Configuration Manager providing persistent settings, the MCP Client managing external server interactions, and the MCP Agent performing the core intelligent tasks.

### Command Line Interface (CLI)
The primary user interface for `mcp-use`, responsible for parsing command-line arguments, validating inputs, and dispatching commands to initiate project setup, manage server configurations, or execute agent workflows. It serves as the initial entry point for user interaction.

### Details

The mcp_use subsystem is designed to facilitate robust and flexible interaction with various MCP servers. At its core, the MCPClient acts as the central orchestrator, managing server configurations, session lifecycles, and task execution. It leverages the ServerManager to discover and manage available MCP servers and their associated tools, providing a centralized registry. For establishing and maintaining connections, MCPClient creates MCPSession instances, which in turn rely on BaseConnector to abstract the complexities of different communication protocols. Asynchronous or long-running operations are delegated to BaseTaskManager, ensuring efficient resource management and task completion. This architecture promotes modularity, allowing for easy integration of new server types and communication methods while maintaining a clear separation of concerns.

### MCPClient

### Details

The mcp_use project employs a modular architecture for observability and telemetry. The ObservabilityManager serves as a central point for handling various observability callbacks, facilitating flexible integration with platforms like Langfuse and Laminar, and enabling other components to register for event notifications. Concurrently, the Telemetry component is responsible for collecting and transmitting anonymized usage data, including agent execution details and package download information, to external services such as PostHog and Scarf. The ObservabilityManager generates events that the Telemetry component can consume, allowing for the capture of detailed operational metrics and insights, thereby ensuring robust, extensible, and maintainable observability and telemetry functionalities through a clear separation of concerns.

### Telemetry
This component is responsible for the collection, formatting, and potential transmission of various telemetry data types, including metrics, traces, and logs. It captures data pertaining to agent execution, tool utilization, and interactions with LLMs, providing insights into the system's operational health and performance.

### Details

The `mcp-use` project is structured around a core `Agent Orchestration Core` that leverages external tools and services to interact with the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The `Command Line Interface (CLI)` serves as the primary entry point, allowing users to initiate and manage MCP projects. It interacts with the `MCP Communication & Management` component to establish and maintain connections with MCP servers, which in turn relies on the `Authentication Service` for secure access.

The `Agent Orchestration Core` is responsible for the intelligent orchestration of tasks, utilizing `Tool & Adapter Framework` to convert MCP-specific tools and resources into a format consumable by the agent (e.g., LangChain). This framework acts as an abstraction layer, ensuring interoperability. During its operation, the `Agent Orchestration Core` reports execution events and metrics to the `Observability & Telemetry` component, which provides insights into agent performance and behavior. Conversely, `Observability & Telemetry` also provides callback handlers to the `Agent Orchestration Core` for real-time event observation. The `MCP Communication & Management` component not only handles session management but also provides the raw tool, resource, and prompt definitions that the `Tool & Adapter Framework` then adapts for the agent's use. This architecture ensures a clear separation of concerns, enabling modular development and maintainability, while facilitating a robust and observable agent-server interaction.
