  "description": "The mcp_use project employs a modular architecture for observability and telemetry. The ObservabilityManager serves as a central point for handling various observability callbacks, facilitating flexible integration with platforms like Langfuse and Laminar, and enabling other components to register for event notifications. Concurrently, the Telemetry component is responsible for collecting and transmitting anonymized usage data, including agent execution details and package download information, to external services such as PostHog and Scarf. The ObservabilityManager generates events that the Telemetry component can consume, allowing for the capture of detailed operational metrics and insights, thereby ensuring robust, extensible, and maintainable observability and telemetry functionalities through a clear separation of concerns.",
