## Details

This subsystem is responsible for establishing, maintaining, and terminating communication sessions with the MCP server, providing a reliable interface for AI agent operations. It adheres to the "Client-Server (Internal)" and "Transport Layer" architectural patterns.

### MCPClient
This component serves as the high-level orchestration layer and primary interface for users or other agent components to interact with the MCP system. Its core responsibility is to manage the lifecycle of multiple `MCPSession` instances, including their creation (potentially from various configuration sources) and their controlled closure. It acts as the central entry point for initiating and managing connections to the MCP server.

### MCPSession
This component represents a single, active, and asynchronous communication session with the MCP server. Its responsibility is to handle the low-level connection details, including establishing (`connect`) and tearing down (`disconnect`) the actual network link. The use of asynchronous context management (`__aenter__` and `__aexit__`) ensures proper resource allocation and deallocation for each session, making it resilient and efficient.
