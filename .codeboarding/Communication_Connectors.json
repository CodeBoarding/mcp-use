  "description": "The `Communication Connectors` component is fundamental to the `LLM Agent Framework/Orchestration Library` because it provides the essential communication layer for the `MCPAgent` to interact with various MCP servers and execute tools. This component embodies the **Adapter Pattern**, abstracting the complexities of different communication protocols (WebSocket, HTTP, Sandbox, Stdio) behind a unified `BaseConnector` interface. This modular design allows for easy integration of new communication methods without altering the core agent logic, which is crucial for the framework's extensibility and adaptability in diverse deployment environments.",
