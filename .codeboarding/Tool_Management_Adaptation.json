  "description": "The MCP (Multi-Component Platform) system is designed around a flexible tool management and adaptation architecture. At its core, the `BaseTool` defines a universal interface for all tools, ensuring consistency and interoperability. The `ServerManager` acts as a central registry, managing the lifecycle and accessibility of server-hosted tools, making them available to various agents within the system. For dynamic discovery, the `ToolSearchEngine` indexes and facilitates searching for these tools based on their capabilities. To enable integration with external frameworks, the `BaseAdapter` provides an abstract mechanism for transforming MCP entities. A concrete implementation, the `LangChainAdapter`, specifically adapts MCP tools for seamless consumption by the LangChain framework, highlighting the system's extensibility and focus on external framework compatibility. This architecture promotes modularity, discoverability, and adaptability, crucial for a robust multi-component platform.",
