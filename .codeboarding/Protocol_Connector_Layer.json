  "description": "The `mcp_use.connectors` subsystem is designed to provide a flexible and extensible framework for various communication protocols. The core of this subsystem is the `BaseConnector` abstract class, which defines a unified interface for all connectors, ensuring consistent interaction patterns for operations like connecting, disconnecting, and handling agent requests (e.g., calling tools, listing resources, managing prompts). Concrete implementations like `SandboxConnector`, `StdioConnector`, `HttpConnector`, and `WebSocketConnector` extend this base, each specializing in a particular communication medium. The `Connectors Utility` module provides common helper functions that are leveraged by these concrete connectors, promoting code reuse and maintaining consistency across different protocol implementations.\n\nCritical interaction pathways within this subsystem revolve around the `BaseConnector`'s defined interface. All concrete connectors implement methods such as `connect`, `disconnect`, `call_tool`, and `request`, allowing the higher-level agent components to interact with them uniformly, regardless of the underlying communication protocol. For instance, an agent can initiate a `call_tool` operation, and the specific connector (e.g., `SandboxConnector` for sandboxed execution or `WebSocketConnector` for real-time communication) will handle the protocol-specific details. The `Connectors Utility` module supports these interactions by providing shared functionalities that streamline the implementation of these protocol-specific behaviors.\n\nThe architecture of the `mcp_use.connectors` subsystem is centered around a clear abstraction-implementation pattern. The `BaseConnector` serves as the central abstract component, establishing the contract for all communication. Specialized connectors like `SandboxConnector`, `StdioConnector`, `HttpConnector`, and `WebSocketConnector` inherit from `BaseConnector`, providing concrete implementations for different communication protocols. This inheritance ensures that all connectors adhere to a common interface, simplifying their integration with other parts of the system. The `Connectors Utility` module acts as a supporting component, offering reusable functions that aid in the development and operation of these diverse connectors, thereby promoting modularity and maintainability within the subsystem.",
