  "description": "The Connector Layer subsystem provides a robust and standardized mechanism for the MCPClient to interact with various external MCP servers and tools. It acts as a crucial abstraction layer, enabling protocol-agnostic communication. At its core, the BaseConnector defines a common interface for all communication protocols, ensuring consistency and extensibility. Concrete implementations, such as WebSocketConnector and HTTPConnector, extend this base to handle specific protocol intricacies, facilitating real-time and traditional request-response interactions for the MCPClient.",
