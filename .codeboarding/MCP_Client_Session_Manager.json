  "description": "The MCP subsystem is structured around two primary components: the `MCP Session Manager` and the `MCP Connection Handler`. The `MCP Session Manager` serves as the central orchestrator, managing the complete lifecycle of an MCP communication session. It is responsible for initiating, maintaining, and terminating sessions, providing a robust context for agent-tool interactions. This orchestration is achieved by interacting with the `MCP Connection Handler`, which is responsible for the low-level network connection. The `MCP Session Manager` initiates and terminates the physical connection through the `MCP Connection Handler` and also invokes or queries it for connection-related operations, ensuring a clear separation of concerns between session management and direct network communication.",
