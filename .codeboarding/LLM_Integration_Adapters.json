  "description": "This subsystem is dedicated to enabling seamless communication and data translation between MCP's internal agent representations and external Large Language Model (LLM) frameworks, primarily LangChain. Its core responsibility is to adapt MCP's tools, resources, and prompts into a format consumable by LLMs, manage the execution of MCP operations within an LLM context, and ensure proper error handling and schema compatibility. It acts as the crucial bridge for MCP agents to leverage the capabilities of various LLM providers.",

It acts as a translator and orchestrator, adapting MCP's internal tools, resources, and prompts into a LangChain-compatible format. It handles schema translation, manages asynchronous execution of MCP operations (via `BaseConnector`), and formats errors for effective LLM consumption. This component is crucial for enabling MCP agents to interact with LLMs through LangChain.",
