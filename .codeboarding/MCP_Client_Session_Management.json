  "description": "The `mcp-use` project facilitates agent interaction with external services through a well-defined client-connector architecture. The `MCPClient` acts as the central orchestrator, managing multiple `Session` instances. Each `Session` represents a single, isolated connection to an MCP server, handling its lifecycle from establishment to termination. The `Session` relies on `BaseConnector` implementations to abstract the underlying communication protocols, allowing for flexible integration with various MCP server types. This design promotes modularity and extensibility, enabling the agent framework to adapt to diverse communication requirements without significant changes to its core logic.",
