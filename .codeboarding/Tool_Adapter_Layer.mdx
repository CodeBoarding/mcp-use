## Details

One paragraph explaining the functionality which is represented by this graph. What the main flow is and what is its purpose.

### Tool Adapter Layer [[Expand]](./Tool_Adapter_Layer)
Serves as the overarching abstraction layer responsible for integrating diverse external tools and primitives into the `mcp-use` framework. It provides a consistent interface for the Agent Core, promoting extensibility and tool interoperability by adapting various tool frameworks (e.g., LangChain) into a standardized format.

### BaseAdapter
An abstract base class that defines the common interface and methods for all concrete tool adapters within the `mcp-use` framework. It establishes a consistent contract, ensuring that any new tool framework integrated will adhere to a predictable structure, thereby promoting modularity and maintainability.

### LangChainAdapter
A concrete implementation of the `BaseAdapter`, specifically designed to integrate tools from the LangChain framework. Its primary responsibility is to translate LangChain-specific tool definitions, prompts, and resources into the `mcp-use` framework's standardized format, making LangChain tools usable by the Agent Core.
