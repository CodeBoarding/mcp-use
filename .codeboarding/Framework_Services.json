  "description": "The Framework Services component provides essential cross-cutting functionalities that are fundamental for the entire mcp_use framework's operation, consistency, and observability. It acts as a foundational layer, offering shared utilities and systems that various other core components rely upon. In an LLM Agent Framework, robust infrastructure services are crucial. Framework Services ensures that agents, clients, and managers can consistently access configuration, log events for debugging and monitoring, and collect performance metrics without reimplementing these functionalities. This promotes modularity, reduces boilerplate, and enhances the overall maintainability and observability of the system.",
