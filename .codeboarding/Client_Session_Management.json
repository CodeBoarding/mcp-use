  "description": "The Client & Session Management subsystem, primarily defined by the `mcp_use.client` and `mcp_use.session` modules, encapsulates the logic for establishing, maintaining, and terminating connections to MCP servers. It manages the overall user session lifecycle within the `mcp-use` framework, providing the capability to manage multiple, potentially concurrent, connections to various MCP servers, which is essential for agents interacting with diverse services or other agents.",

      "name": "Client Session Orchestrator",
      "description": "This component is responsible for the high-level orchestration and aggregation of multiple client sessions. It manages the creation, lifecycle, and termination of individual sessions, acting as a central point for managing the overall client-side connectivity to MCP servers. This aligns with the \"Orchestration\" pattern, enabling the framework to manage multiple concurrent agent interactions. Its role is crucial for scaling and managing complex multi-agent scenarios.",
