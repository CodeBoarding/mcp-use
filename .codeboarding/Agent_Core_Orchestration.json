      "name": "SystemPromptBuilder",
      "description": "This function is responsible for dynamically constructing the system prompt for the LLM agent. It incorporates tool descriptions, conversation history, and additional instructions, which are crucial for guiding the LLM's behavior and enabling it to effectively use available tools.",

      "name": "ServerManager",
      "description": "Manages the discovery, connection, and organization of tools from multiple MCP servers. It acts as a central registry for all available tools that the `MCPAgent` can potentially utilize, abstracting away the complexities of tool retrieval from various sources.",

      "name": "LangChainAdapter",
      "description": "This component is crucial for interoperability. It converts the generic MCP tool definitions into a format compatible with the LangChain framework, allowing the `MCPAgent` to seamlessly integrate and execute these tools within a LangChain-based agent executor.",
