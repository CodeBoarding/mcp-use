  "description": "The `mcp-use` subsystem is orchestrated by the Command Line Interface (CLI), which serves as the primary user interaction point. The CLI is responsible for initiating various operations, including project setup and managing agent workflows. It interacts with the Configuration Manager to load and persist application and project-specific settings, ensuring consistent behavior across sessions. For interacting with external MCP servers, the CLI leverages the MCP Client, which handles communication, server command execution, and status reporting. The core intelligence of the system resides within the MCP Agent, which executes agentic workflows and integrates LLMs and tools. The CLI manages the execution of the MCP Agent and receives feedback on its operations. This architecture ensures a clear separation of concerns, with the CLI handling user input and orchestration, the Configuration Manager providing persistent settings, the MCP Client managing external server interactions, and the MCP Agent performing the core intelligent tasks.",
