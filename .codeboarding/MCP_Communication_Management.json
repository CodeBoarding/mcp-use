  "description": "The mcp_use subsystem is designed to facilitate robust and flexible interaction with various MCP servers. At its core, the MCPClient acts as the central orchestrator, managing server configurations, session lifecycles, and task execution. It leverages the ServerManager to discover and manage available MCP servers and their associated tools, providing a centralized registry. For establishing and maintaining connections, MCPClient creates MCPSession instances, which in turn rely on BaseConnector to abstract the complexities of different communication protocols. Asynchronous or long-running operations are delegated to BaseTaskManager, ensuring efficient resource management and task completion. This architecture promotes modularity, allowing for easy integration of new server types and communication methods while maintaining a clear separation of concerns.",
